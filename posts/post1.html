            <h1>spooky season is over</h1>
            <p class="date">november 1, 2020</p>
            <p>hello. this is my very first blog post!  my boyfriend, peter, helped me create this website last night. since i’m unsure of the direction i’m going to take this blog, i want to start with something super simple that I am passionate about: music.</p>
            <p>before i get started though, i want to talk about what inspired me to do this.  i have an amazing friend named sara who was so excited to have me read her personal blog posts.  she has been through some awful things recently; i’m envious of her ability to at least try to stay positive and be a good friend, person, and coworker.</p>
            <p>this morning, i had a pretty intense weightlifting session with one of my best lady friends, julia, and i’m absolutely exhausted.  the first thing i noticed today was how chilly it was outside, and how fast the wind was blowing.  i love fall.  halloween has come and gone, though, and spooky season is my favorite season.  even though we are amidst my favorite time of year (aside from christmas), the seasonal sadness is right around the corner and i’m trying to mentally prepare.  that’s where music comes in!  so, let me just take you through some songs i’ve collected over the past couple of years that remind me of the feeling of walking through the dead, crunching leaves on campus with the wind burning my face (and sometimes loving every second of it).  </p>
            <br>

            <b><p>almira - tyson motsenbocker</b> </p>
            <p>i remember hearing this song, and ep, for the first time during my freshman year of college.  if i had to choose one song to perfectly suit the scene for what i described before, i would choose this song.  it also reminds me of meeting my first friend, ian, in college.  we were in a stupid writing class, and both of us were too good of writers to put up with everyone else’s tragic essays.  so he drew on the desks and i passed him notes.  and after class, we walked back to the dorms together complaining about how 1) we hated that class and robin’s half-british accent and 2) i wanted a boyfriend and he wanted a girlfriend (we could’ve never been into each other, though, we were too similar–twins even).  </p>
            <br>

            <p><b>look ma! - benjamin francis leftwich</b></p>
            <p>i don’t have a ton to say about this song other than it’s just good.  i’m not entirely sure what the song is actually about, but to me, this song is about recovering from being sick, sad, or both, and being proud enough to be like “look mama, i’m doing okay.  aren’t you proud of me?” benjamin francis leftwich makes great music for this time of year.  highly recommend.    </p>
            <br>
                
            <p><b>coals - modern baseball</b></p>
            <p>i had to include a modern baseball song.  i chose this one because the intro riff is cool, and it has sort of a homemade quality to it.  if you and your friends like modern baseball or pop punk in general, this is a good one to jam to together if someone can play guitar, or even just in the car.  it reminds me of driving to a hiking trail in the morning.  </p>
            <br>

            <p><b>lucky for you - novo amor ft. gia margaret</b></p>
            <p>novo amor overall is great to listen to during the fall/winter seasons.  this one is pretty sad, especially if you find yourself being an insecure person.  though i feel pretty confident in who i am as a person, this song still hurts pretty bad on the days where i feel like i don’t look my best, or when i’m away from peter for too long (that’s kind of not okay actually, but i can’t help it).</p>
            <br>

            <p><b>watch you sleep - girl in red</b></p>
            <p>ok this song used to be so sad to me.  i was really sad when i listened to this song for the first time, but now that i’m with peter, it’s come to have a new meaning.  and i do watch him sleep :) in a loving way, of course. </p>
            <br>

            <p><b>killer & the sound - phoebe bridgers & noah gunderson</b></p>
            <p>phoebe bridgers is a great lyricist.  most of her songs are actually so sad, it’s rough.  i’m kind of now realizing that “sad season” is probably just because i listen to these sad songs.  but then again, that’s a year-round thing anyway.  okay, so this song is a blend of two different songs, and i prefer this version to both of those individual songs.  listen to this song before you go to sleep.  lay in bed with your eyes closed.  that’ll get you real depressed.</p>
            <br>

            <p><b>pictures - judah & the lion ft. kacey musgraves</b></p>
            <p>the collaboration between these two artists was one of those things you needed but didn’t even know you needed.  if you have recently gone through a breakup, don’t listen to this.  it’ll hurt.  but kacey musgraves has the cutest alternative country voice.  and it’s fun to sing it in the car alone.</p>
            <br>

            <p><b>bummer summer - charmer</b></p>
            <p>this one is a little different from the others.  i love the twinkly, math rock guitar riffs throughout the song, and the aggressive yelling toward the end.  i feel less alone when i hear it.  i’m not the only one faking the “getting better” thing.  </p>
            <br>

            <p>this actually took me longer than i thought it would.  i tend to leave things unfinished so i’m glad i at least got through this in one shot.  hopefully i keep updating.  that’s all for today, so enjoy the songs.  
            </p>
