            <h1>mulligoon arises</h1>
            <p class="date">february 3, 2021</p>
            <p>upon creating this website/blog/journal thing, i was pretty unsure about what i wanted out of it.
                i think i now know where i want to go from here.</p>
            <p>let me go into this name i chose first. "mulligoon" is basically just a mixture of my little nickname on tik tok - 
                yung looney gooney - and the name of a pretty awesome band - hot mulligan - .  the word "mulligan" is kind of silly. 
                it has a few meanings actually.  from what i know, it's a golf term where a player is given a free shot due to their
                previous shot going awry.  it's a do-over!  google also says that it is a type of stew.  but i like the first meaning more.
                my silly self is giving myself a do-over.  a do-over in what, you may ask?</p>
            <p>well, in everything, to be honest!</p>
            <p>i'm freeing myself from the negativity, the paranoia, the anxiety, the frustration, the anger â€“ all that stuff.
                at least i'll be trying to.  it's not an overnight thing, of course, nor a permanent thing, but it's a start.</p>
            <p>so you guys, my readers, are my <i>goonies</i> :) and i will address you all as such. </p>
            <br>
            <p>now that that's aside, let's get into more content-related things.</p>
            <p>i don't have a schedule for this, so as a full-time student and part-time worker, i usually have little
                time to write.  i'm just going to post what i feel, when i feel like (since i don't really have regular
                readers, this is more so just for me to remind myself).  right now, i have so many plans for posts.  
                i want to have a little fitness series, a thrift fashion series, more playlist posts, and general updates. 
                i'm pretty excited for the future of my website.  it's starting to bloom!  
            </p>
            <p>well, goonies, that's my first 2021 update, and i hope you keep checking in for more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>before, i go, i'm going to plug my <a class="fun-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/shi.doodles/" target="_blank">sister's art page</a>.  dm her for commissions and to buy prints!</p>
