            <h2>TO YOU GOONIES</h2>
            <p>this website is still under construction. feel free to browse and giggle at this clownery.  thank u peter for the help.</p>
            <p>hello, my name is <B>taqiyah</B>, or t for short, or q for another form of short.  welcome to mulligoon, my collection of
                my personal things like thoughts, playlists, song lyrics, and some pretty photos of my friends and family.  i don't know who will 
                read this thing, probably just my friends, but i hope you find something in here that you like.   </p>
            <p>so here are some things about me!  i am currently a biochemistry student at virginia tech.  i really enjoy what i study 
                even though things get super hectic super fast.  i'm planning to work in the forensic science field once i 
                get my master's degree.  i love true crime podcasts, so if you have any reccomendations please reach out to me 
                on one of my socials.  
                in my free time, i play field hockey on the club team here at virginia tech and i also write/play music.  
                in the "music" section of this site, you can read the lyrics of some of my finished and unfinished original songs 
                that are found on my soundcloud.
            </p>
