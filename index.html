            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>this website is still under construction. feel free to browse and giggle at this clownery.  thank u peter for the help.</p>
            <p>hi, my name is taqiyah, or t for short, or q for another form of short.  this site is basically just a collection of
                my personal things like thoughts, playlists, song lyrics, and some pretty photos of my friends and family.  i don't know who will 
                read this thing, probably just my friends, but i hope you find something in here that you like.   </p>
            <p>so here are some things about me!  i am currently a biochemistry student at virginia tech.  i really enjoy what i study 
                even though things get super hectic super fast.  i work at a little tea shop called tea & jam, so if you need tea recommendations
                let me know.  in my free time, i play field hockey on the club team here at virginia tech and i also write/play music.  
                in the "music" section of this site, it'll link you to my soundcloud, but sometime here soon i'll be posting both unfinished and
                finished lyrics of my originals.
            </p>
            <p>that's mostly all i have to say here for now.  </p>
